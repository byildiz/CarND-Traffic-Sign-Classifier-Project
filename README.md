# **Traffic Sign Recognition**

Overview
---
In this project, I used what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks lesson from [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) program. to classify traffic signs. trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

After the model was trained, I then tried out my model on images of German traffic signs that I found both on the web and Google street view.

The project code is provided as an [Ipython notebook](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).

I also created a detailed writeup which is given in [writeup.md ](./writeup.md) file for this project.

Please see the [writeup.md ](./writeup.md) file for more details.
